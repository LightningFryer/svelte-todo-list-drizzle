# A Simple Todo List

This project is a simple todo list which uses Google's OAuth to keep track of your todos. It is built using the following stack:

- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [Tailwindcss](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
- [Skeleton UI library](https://www.skeleton.dev/)
- [Drizzle ORM*](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- [TursoDB](https://turso.tech/)

Why did I use Drizzle, which is still not complete, instead of prisma? Refer to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqhHXe746Ns) video by ThePrimeTime.
