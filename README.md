# A simple Todo List
This website was just a simple hobby project of mine to learn how to make a full stack website using the following stack:

### Frontend
- Sveltekit
- Tailwindcss
- Skeleton UI Toolkit
- Phosphor Icons

### Backend
- Supabase
- Drizzle ORM
- Auth.js for OAuth

## Features
This fully featured todo list website includes the following features:
- Create or Delete a todo
- Todos are stored securely in a database (Using Supabase)
- Secure and seamless authentication using Google OAuth (Using Auth.js)
- The website implements responsive design so that it can look pretty on both large and small screens.
